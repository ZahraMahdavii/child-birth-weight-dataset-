In this project, using a public dataset(CBDW) of 1,800 pregnant women, we analyzed 17 maternal factors such as age, parity, and blood pressure to predict infant birth weight. Using advanced ML algorithms, our research showed that the RandomForestClassifier and LogisticRegression models outperformed others and achieved an accuracy of 83.49% in predicting birth weight. While closely followed by KNeighborsClassifier and GaussianNB, the Support Vector Machines model showed considerable potential, albeit with slightly lower accuracy.
